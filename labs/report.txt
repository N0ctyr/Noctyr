Top failed login attempts:
2 attempts alice from 192.168.1.23
1 attempt root from 192.168.1.23
1 attempt bob from 10.0.0.55 (also had a successful login)
1 attempt admin from 172.16.0.45

Summary:
192.168.1.23 is unreachable (likely simulated or inactive host)
10.0.0.55 responded earlier but showed filtered ports (possibly legit or secured)
NO real brute-force activity detected in live logs.

Recommendations:
1. Use fail2ban or sshguard to block repeated failed logins.
2. Disable password authentication, use SSH keys.
3. Monitor journalctl and /var/log/auth.log regularly.
